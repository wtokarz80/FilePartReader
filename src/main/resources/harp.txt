Welcome to HarpTabs.com. Our goal is to have a website where everyone can find and share all of their Harmonica Tabs in one central location.
For anyone who doesn't know what a tab is, a tab is like sheet music for someone who can not read sheet music.
It will show the notes for a song with numbers representing each hole on the harmonica.
If you want to brush up on your harmonica skills you can check out JP Allen's Harmonica Lessons.
Please feel free to look around and post the harp tabs you have or request ones you are looking for.
We have 45126 members and 24951 songs.
